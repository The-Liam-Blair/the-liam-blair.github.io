        Patapon Meditate is the second mod I developed for Risk of Rain 2. It simply adjusts the UI and audio for the Meditate skill, which is used by the Seeker character, to be Patapon themed and includes adjustments to the input sequence to also include command sequences from Patapon.
        
        <br><br>
        Developed after seeing an online post comparing the Seeker's meditate skill to Patapon's iconic drum input sequence, it was initially only made for fun and for myself, and as a break from developing my main mod Rigs Arsenal. I then decided to publish this mod as it increasingly became more higher quality and fun than I envisioned, and I thought that other fans of Risk of Rain and Patapon would enjoy using this mod.
        <br><br>
        This mod also served as my introduction to the CIL (Common Intermediate Language), a low level stack-based language that I used to overwrite the original sounds for the meditate skill with my own sounds.

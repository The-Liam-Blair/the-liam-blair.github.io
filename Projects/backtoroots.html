        Submission for the 2023 Global Game Jam (With the theme of "Roots"), Back to Roots is a short horde shooter about finding your family-turned "Haunted" from the woods and taking matters into your own hands.
        <br><br>
        Developed with a 5-man team, I was responsible for implementing the combat mechanics and visuals for the flamethrower, which was handled using a particle system. Initially starting out as just a simple square hitbox for the flamethrower's damage collider, it soon expanded to using the colliders on the flame particles to register damage events for better control of the weapon. Finally a damage-over-time effect was added, as well as flashy damage numbers, to make the combat visually more appealing and impactful.

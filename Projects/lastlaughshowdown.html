        Submission for the 2024 Global Game Jam (With the theme of "Make Me Laugh"), Last Laugh Showdown is a 2 player fighting game featuring silly fisticuff attacks, sounds and visuals. Developed as part of a 6-man team.
        <br><br> I was responsible for developing the combat mechanics, which included a punch attack, kick attack and a charged spinning dash attack. To make the combat more slapstick, each attack inflicts a strong knockback force on the opposing player, combined with bouncy invisible walls across the arena boundaries to make each player bounce and move chaotically, but not uncontrollably, through the arena as they fight. 
        <br><br>The charged spin attack is the main attack that represents this combat design, having no upper limit on the knockback it can inflict as it is charged up, enough to knockback the opposing player through the arena boundaries. This bug then became a feature as being knocked through the arena boundaries was modified to also instantly defeat that player.

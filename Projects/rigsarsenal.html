        Rigs Arsenal is the first and largest mod I have developed for Risk of Rain 2. It currently adds 12 varied items and 3 equipment into the game, with each having it's own unique model and in-game usage.
        <br><br>
        Acting as my first introduction to modding, I learned to utilise Unity asset bundles to package model and textures to be imported into the game while item implementations were handled mostly initially with hooks onto pre-existing vanilla functions, such as the TakeDamage() function to add or modify damage events if a certain item was held. Later on, I also integrated Harmony patching for a few items instead of hooks as they are more stable. This mod also served as my introduction to the 3D modelling software Blender, which I used to create the models for each item.
        <br><br>Initially the project took about eight months to complete from inception, and on release included seven items. Now, over a year after release, a further five items and three equipment have been implemented, as well as balance updates and bug fixes as identified by myself and the Risk of Rain 2 community.

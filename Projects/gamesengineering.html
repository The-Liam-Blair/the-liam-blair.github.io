        Maze Escape is a simple top down 2D game developed during my penultimate year in university, with this group project focused on developing a game from scratch using the SFML and Box2D libraries in C++.
        <br><br>Like the name implies, the goal of the game is to navigate through a series of mazes and reach the exit within the timer, with the goal being to reach the exit with as much time remaining as possible. The timer also acts as a resource, with powerups in each level being available to pick up that grant temporary but powerful effects (Such as increased speed or widened vision), but costing time to use. Thus, the player can decide how to optimally make use of their time to determine if a nearby powerup is needed or not to achieve a faster completion time.
        <br><br>With my project partner Mikha, we drafted and finalised a game design document, agreed on the game themes, mechanics and features, then cooperated on the implementation of the game. While Mihka focused on implementing the menus, level designs and texturing, I focused more on implementing the powerups and gameplay.
